/************************************************************
To design an effective Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) bot that can perform well in the described tournament, let's consider a strategy that not only maximizes points against a variety of opponents but also performs well in self-play scenarios. The game rules and scoring system encourage a strategy that is adaptable, as the different point values for winning with rock vs. scissors or paper necessitate a more nuanced approach than simply randomizing moves.
Strategy Concept

Given the unique scoring system and the requirement to perform well against various strategies, including predictive (e.g., "Learner"), mimicking (e.g., "Mirror"), and cycling patterns (e.g., "Cycler" variants), our bot should incorporate elements of unpredictability, adaptation, and counter-strategy. Here's a proposed approach:

    Adaptive Learning: The bot should analyze the opponent's past moves to detect patterns or biases (e.g., a preference for certain moves or a cyclic pattern) and adjust its strategy accordingly. This requires maintaining a move history and possibly calculating move frequencies or detecting sequences.

    Randomness with a Twist: Utilize the provided rnd for making decisions to ensure fairness and unpredictability, but not purely. Instead, adjust the randomness based on observed opponent patterns. For instance, if the opponent heavily favors "Rock," skew the randomness to favor "Paper."

    Mimicking with Delay: Incorporating a delayed mimicking strategy (similar to "Delayed Mirror") can exploit predictable opponents while avoiding being easily countered by simple reverse strategies.

    Diversification with Score Maximization: Since rock victories are more valuable, the bot could slightly favor "Rock" when the opponent's behavior is highly unpredictable or when the match history does not reveal a clear strategy to exploit.

Sample Implementation

Here's a simplified JavaScript function outline that incorporates these ideas:

function(round, moves, opp_moves, rnd) {
    var move, opp_freq = [0, 0, 0]; // Frequency of opponent moves: R, P, S
    var total_rounds = opp_moves.length;
    for (var i = 0; i < total_rounds; i++) {
        opp_freq["RPS".indexOf(opp_moves[i])]++;
    }

    var most_freq_move = opp_freq.indexOf(Math.max.apply(Math, opp_freq));
    var preferred_move = (most_freq_move + 1) % 3; // Prefer the move that beats the opponent's most frequent move

    if (rnd < 0.33) {
        move = "RPS"[preferred_move]; // Base move on opponent's pattern
    } else if (rnd < 0.66) {
        move = "RPS"[(preferred_move + 1) % 3]; // Alternate to next move
    } else {
        move = "RPS"[(most_freq_move + 2) % 3]; // Less predictable, counter to less frequent move
    }

    // Adjusting for higher value of rock wins, slightly skew towards rock if in doubt
    if (rnd < 0.1 && opp_freq[1] > opp_freq[2]) { // If paper is more common than scissors
        move = "R"; // Favor rock more when beneficial
    }

    return move;
};

This script is a starting point. It tries to adapt based on opponent's move frequency and introduces variability in response. However, for a real tournament setting, further refinements could be necessary, such as deeper pattern analysis (e.g., detecting and exploiting cyclical patterns beyond simple frequency analysis) and incorporating a self-learning component that adjusts strategy based on success rates of different approaches during the tournament.
Testing and Iteration

After implementing your bot, extensively test it against all provided agents and in self-play scenarios to identify and correct any weaknesses. Use the commands provided in the challenge to simulate games and adjust your strategy based on the outcomes.

Remember, the effectiveness of a bot can vary greatly depending on the strategies of other participants, so continuous iteration and testing against a wide range of opponents are crucial for success in the tournament.
